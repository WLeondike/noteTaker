# Note Taker: Made with Express

  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

  In this application, the user will be able to write, save, and delete notes they create. This application is created using express. We had to use ``` app.get ``` to fetch data, ``` app.post ``` for the input data to be written to the page, and lastly ``` app.delete ``` to delete the stored note.
